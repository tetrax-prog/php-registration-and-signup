 this code is divided into the 3 way programming method that php uses, having a model that interacts with the DB, a view file that handles what the user sees, a contr file that sits between model and view files and controls what happens between the two
 The config_session.inc.php file deals with sessions
 The dbh.inc.php deals with the database
 The files starting with signup deal with registration and the files starting with login deal with login

 --------------------------YOU MAY GET AN ERROR SUCH AS----------------------

---------THIS TYPE OF ERROR DEPENDS ON WHAT PHP 8 VERSION YOU ARE USING SO YOU MAY GET OR NOT GET IT-----
